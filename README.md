## 🎯 Overview

**Journey through ancient China!** **Hybrid RPG** is an open-source **Hybrid RPG** prototype being developed in **Unreal Engine 5.3.1**. It uniquely blends animated **2D characters** (powered by the **[PaperZD](https://www.fab.com/listings/6664e3b5-e376-47aa-a0dd-f7bbbd5b93c0)** plugin) with immersive **3D environments**. The project focuses on **exploration**, **NPC interaction**, and uncovering **narrative threads**, all viewed from a **top-down style camera**.

This project serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating skills in Unreal Engine, Blueprint scripting, integrating specialized plugins (PaperZD), and building foundational RPG systems within a unique visual style. *(Note: Project name is temporary; creative name brainstorming planned!)*

## 📜 Premise (Placeholder - Story in Development)

> Whispers echo through the winding streets of the ancient city – tales of forgotten magic, hidden passages, and secrets held close by its inhabitants. As a traveler newly arrived [or perhaps seeking something specific?], you step onto the timeworn stones. The air hums with untold stories. What mysteries will you unravel as you explore the bustling markets, serene temples, and shadowy alleys? Your journey begins now...

*(This is a placeholder premise. A more defined story is currently under development!)*

## ✨ Key Features (Planned & In-Progress)

*   🎭 **Hybrid 2D/3D Presentation:** The core visual style featuring 2D sprite characters navigating and interacting within a fully 3D world.
*   🚶‍♂️ **Top-Down Exploration:** Smooth character movement and camera controls designed for exploring the detailed city environment.
*   📜 **PaperZD Integration:** Utilizing [PaperZD](https://www.fab.com/listings/6664e3b5-e376-47aa-a0dd-f7bbbd5b93c0) for advanced 2D character animation state machines, notifications, and potentially gameplay logic integration.
*   💬 **NPC Interaction System (Planned):** Framework for initiating dialogue, simple quests, or receiving information from city dwellers.
*   🗺️ **Ancient Chinese Setting:** Establishing the art style and atmosphere of a historical (or fantasy-inspired historical) Chinese city.
*   📖 **Narrative Framework (Planned):** Basic systems to support discovering story elements through interaction and exploration.
*   💡 **100% Blueprint Driven:** Developed entirely using Unreal Engine's Blueprint visual scripting.
*   🔄 **Dynamic Camera:** Camera that follows the player while maintaining a consistent angle/view.

## ▶️ Getting Started / Running the Project

**Option 1: Play Packaged Build (Not Yet Available)** 🎮

*   *Once available, instructions to download and run a pre-built version will be here.*

**Option 2: From Source (For Developers - Requires Unreal Engine 5.3.1 & PaperZD)** 🔧

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FahimKamal/UE5_HybridRPG.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate** to the cloned project directory (`UE5_HybridRPG`).
3.  **Ensure Unreal Engine 5.5.1** is installed via the Epic Games Launcher.
4.  **⚠️ Important: PaperZD Plugin Requirement:**
    *   This project requires the **free** [PaperZD Plugin](https://www.fab.com/listings/6664e3b5-e376-47aa-a0dd-f7bbbd5b93c0).
    *   The plugin *should* be included in the project's `Plugins` folder in this repository. When you open the project, Unreal Engine *should* detect it automatically.
    *   **If you encounter errors** mentioning a missing PaperZD plugin or the project fails to load: Please ensure you have **obtained and installed PaperZD** for your UE **5.5.1** engine installation (e.g., add it via the Epic Games Launcher Library if you acquired it there, or place it in `Epic Games/UE_5.5/Engine/Plugins`). You can get it here: [https://www.fab.com/listings/6664e3b5-e376-47aa-a0dd-f7bbbd5b93c0](https://www.fab.com/listings/6664e3b5-e376-47aa-a0dd-f7bbbd5b93c0)
5.  **Open** the `.uproject` file (`UE5_HybridRPG.uproject`) by double-clicking it.
6.  **Press Play** in the editor toolbar to run the current state of the project.
